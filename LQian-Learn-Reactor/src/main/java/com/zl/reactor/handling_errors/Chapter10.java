/**
 * Handling Exceptions in Operators or Functions
 * <p>
 * In general, all operators can themselves contain code that potentially trigger an exception or calls to a
 * user-defined callback that can similarly fail, so they all contain some form of error handling.
 * <p>
 * Reactor, however, defines a set of exceptions (such as OutOfMemoryError) that are always deemed fatal. See the
 * Exceptions.throwIfFatal method. These errors mean that Reactor cannot keep operating and are thrown rather than propagated.
 * <p>
 * Internally, there are also cases where an unchecked exception still cannot be propagated (most notably during the
 * subscribe and request phases), due to concurrency races that could lead to double onError or onComplete conditions.
 * When these races happen, the error that cannot be propagated is "dropped". These cases can still be managed to some
 * extent via customizable hooks, see Dropping Hooks.
 * https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/reference/#hooks-dropping
 * <p>
 * <p>
 * You may ask: "What about Checked Exceptions?"
 * If, for example, you need to call some method that declares it throws exceptions, you still have to deal with those
 * exceptions in a try-catch block. You have several options, though:
 * 1.Catch the exception and recover from it. The sequence continues normally.
 * 2.Catch the exception and wrap it into an unchecked exception, then throw it (interrupting the sequence).
 * The Exceptions utility class can help you with that.
 * 3.If you are expected to return a Flux (for example, you are in a flatMap), wrap the exception in an
 * error-producing Flux: return Flux.error(checkedException). (The sequence also terminates.)
 * <p>
 * Reactor has an Exceptions utility class that you can use to ensure that exceptions are wrapped only if they
 * are checked exceptions:
 * 1.Use the Exceptions.propagate method to wrap exceptions, if necessary. It also calls throwIfFatal first and does
 * not wrap RuntimeException.
 * 2.Use the Exceptions.unwrap method to get the original unwrapped exception (going back to the root cause of a
 * hierarchy of reactor-specific exceptions).
